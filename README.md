# Musix
Musix is project I'm working on for the Nights and Weekends S1 hosted by buildspace.

What if there was a music incentive platform that allowed users to spot high quality songs earlier than others? 
This would be a great way for music lovers to get their hands on the best new tunes before anyone else. 
Not only would it be a fun way to discover new music, but it would also incentivize users to keep their ear to the ground for the latest and greatest hits

well, I'm trying to create the answer to that question
